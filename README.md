# FareStart
These are programs to support development at FareStart.org - a Seattle organization for training people to work in the restaurant trades
The repository is an extension of work I did for other organizations in the repository lordjoe/SpreadSheetTools - it is cloned to allow reomval of code irrelevant to the work for FareStart and to allow addition of APIs for tools specific to the restaurant Environment.
Code development used Maven and IntelliJ
